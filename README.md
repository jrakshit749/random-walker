# Random Walker
###### This project is where I make a random walker which will move towards different locations of the canvas without having it to overlapp itself.

- This project is aimed towards learning p5.js and implementing it. 
- This project creates multiply random walkers each time the page is reloaded and those random walkers fill up the space near them and move around with 10FPS.
- Feel free to fork my code and tweak it according to your requirements.
### Happy Coding!
